## Dependecies

To install all package dependencies for our project, we recommend creating a virtual environment. 
The required packages are contained in `requirements.txt` and should be installed using:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 #for Windows powershell
source venv/bin/activate #for Linux

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
